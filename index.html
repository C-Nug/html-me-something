  <p>Sergio was born on the 29th of October, 2015. Sergio was cultivated by wild yeast strands found in the heart
    of the Sonoron Desert. His birth process was a slow and grueling one. His overlord, Charles Wallace McNugget III,
    had tried raising wild yeast before but only resulted in buds that suffered slow and painful deaths by the
    membranes of the <em>Bacillus licheniformis</em>. Sergio, however was given enough gluten and warmth to survive.
    After six days of being split in twain and fed just enough to keep from starving, Sergio emerged a strong and
    gassy yeast. Charles quickly put him to work. Sergio's first bread he produced was only just edible. It would seem
    Sergio was still a little slow to on the gaseous uptake, but soon Sergio would rise above all expectations of his
    ruthless overlord.</p>
