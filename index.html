    <h3><a name = "early">Early Life</a></h3>
    <p>S&#233rgio was born on the 29th of October, 2015. S&#233rgio was cultivated by wild yeast strands found in the heart
      of the Sonoron Desert. His birth process was a slow and grueling one. His overlord, Charles Wallace McNugget III,
      had tried raising wild yeast before but only resulted in buds that suffered slow and painful deaths by the
      membranes of the <em>Bacillus licheniformis</em>. S&#233rgio, however was given enough gluten and warmth to survive.
      After six days of being split in twain and fed just enough to keep from starving, S&#233rgio emerged a strong and
      gassy yeast. Charles quickly put him to work. S&#233rgio's first bread he produced was only just edible. It would seem
      S&#233rgio was still a little slow to on the gaseous uptake, but soon S&#233rgio would rise above all expectations of his
      ruthless overlord.</p>
